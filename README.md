# Complain-Management-System
This project involves constructing a complaint management system which is a data driven website which can potentially be used by any organisation that needs an online complaint portal or even a feedback collection site. The website has three major components: user registration, complaint registration and history of all registered complaints. The implementation uses a tool called Django Framework which is an excellent open-source web application framework for complex data-driven website development.
A flow-chart of a kind is created to envision the working of the site.
It includes the major components that are supposed to be added in the user interface
later. It also helps to visualize the user experience.

First a base template is created which has all the basic page components of the site lite
margins, menu bars and stylesheets. All the rest templates will be extensions of this base
template. This means that the components on the base template will be displayed on all the
pages. Then other templates are creted: about, register, login, logout, profile,
new_complaint, complaint_history, home.
